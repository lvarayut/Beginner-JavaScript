// 1. Create a function called "createMultiplicationTable" which accepts a number called "num" as a parameter
// 2. In the function, loop from 1 to 12 and print out, for example if the "num" was set to 2:
//// 2 * 1 = 2
//// 2 * 2 = 4
//// ...
//// 2 * 11 = 22
//// 2 * 12 = 24
// Bonus: Rewrite the code using while and do...while

// Start coding here


createMultiplicationTable(2);
