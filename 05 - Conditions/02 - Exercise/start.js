// 1. Create a function called "getSign" which accepts "a" and "b" parameters
// 2. Create the following conditions:
//// 2.1 If "a" times "b" is a positive number, print out "The sign is +"
//// 2.2 If "a" times "b" is equal to zero, print out "There is no sign"
//// 2.3 Otherwise, print out "The sign is -"
// Bonus: Rewrite the conditions using switch case and ternary


// Start writing code

getSign(2, -5);
