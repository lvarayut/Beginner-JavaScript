// 1. Create a function called "squareNumbers" that accepts "nums" as a parameter, which is the array type
// 2. The function should loop through the "nums" and return a new array where each element is squared

/// Start coding here

console.log(squareNumbers(arr)); // Should print out [1, 4, 9, 16]
