// 1. Create a function called "factorial" which accepts "n" as a parameter
// 2. The function should calculate a factorial of the given "n" using the following factorial rule
//// f(1) = 1;
//// f(2) = 2 * f(1)
//// f(3) = 3 * f(2)
//// f(4) = 4 * f(3) => 24
//// ...so on

/// Start coding here

console.log(factorial(4)); // Should print out 24
